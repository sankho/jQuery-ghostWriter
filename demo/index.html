		<h1>jQuery Ghost Writer!</h1>
		<p id="talk">The most useless plugin ever. Yes, yes, perhaps I could put my efforts to things that are substantially more useful for the world. But, meh. Notice how as I type, the letters come at changing frequencies, as if someone was really typing. Kind of. Remember that show Ghostwriter? I used to date a girl that used to date the black dude in that show. Crazy right?</p>
